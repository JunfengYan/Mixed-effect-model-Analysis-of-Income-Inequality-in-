## Instructions

To complete this report, open the template Rmd file and write your report. Make sure to hide all code but include that necessary code in the Rmd to create the visualizations and the tables that you need. When done, knit the file to pdf or html format. Provide any comments/questions about this report in the section below 

**Learning Goals:** This is an opportunity synthesize all that you've learned about correlated and demonstrate your understanding by writing a concise, but thorough report on your analysis. You should go beyond what you did in the initial report, considering other research questions, refine the original work, and take feedback into account. 

**Comments/Questions to Prof. H:** 



*Next section to be completed by Prof. H and preceptors. Do not type below this line.*

## Feedback 

Heggeseth Feedback:

- Overall, much improved
- Better intro
- Just because countries start at a different level doesn't necessarily mean that mixed effects should be used. There could be another explanatory variable that could explain that difference in level. Remember that random intercepts and slopes are just ways to model correlation. Your justification for the model is based on plots over time but time wasn't a variable used in the model.
- Too many graphs; many of them are not insightful or are not needed for the narrative
- the model2 equation isn't correct, if b_i,trade is a slope then it should be multiple by trade.
- What are the units of gini index? I don't think it is percent. When interpreting coefficients, you need to include 'accounting for other variables' and be careful when you use the phrase 'increase by 1%', that implies a multiplicative increase of 1.01, which isn't the same as adding 1 percentage point. Also, their wage inequality isn't going to just increase, the predicted or average wage inequality is expected to increase/decrease
- What is conditional R squared? Don't include it if you don't know what it is.
- What about the random intercepts of the countries? Which is the greatest estimated value and which is the smallest? 
- Why are your residuals presented before the model?

Grade: 90/100

Overall Feedback:

- Most of my comments revolve around some basic model interpretation issues.
